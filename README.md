## PyUnitConverter

**PyUnitConverter** - a compact, user-friendly desktop utility built with Python and Tkinter that converts between common length, weight, and temperature units. It provides a simple GUI with quick selection of categories and units, accurate conversions, and a tidy, beginner-friendly codebase.
